# ReactRxBingMap
A ReactJS component that allows you to leverage the rich features of Bing Services and [RxBingMaps](https://github.com/erikschlegel/RxBingMap), while bridging all interaction events, pushpins, service calls and map movements as async reactive streams. Currently all API calls into the existing Bing Ajax control are synchronous and blocking invocations. This library converts all map canvas input events, service calls and geo-coordinate transitional movements as observable sequences. This component also exposes a user friendly [service interface](https://github.com/erikschlegel/RxBingServices) into Bing Spatial Data and Location services. You can integrate any [open data REST service(s)](http://www.programmableweb.com/api/nyc-open-data) while utilizing this component to visualize the geolocation content.
